Regression Analysis and Clustering with R programming
Part 1 (Regression analysis)
In this part, you will perform tasks faced by a data scientist working for a housing company. You obtain
the “housing_new” dataset which contains information about different houses in a specific city. Your job
is to make sense of the dataset from different perspectives and to build a regression model that attempts
to explain the value of houses. From your employer you receive the dataset and the following short
information about the dataset:
− PCCR: Per capita crime rate by town
− PRLZ: Proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq. ft
− INDUS: Proportion of non-retail business acres per town
− NOX: Nitric oxide concentration (parts per 10 million)
− AVR: Average number of rooms per dwelling
− AGE: Proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940
− DIS: Weighted distances to five Boston employment centers
− RAD: Index of accessibility to radial highways
− TAX: Full-value property tax rate per $10,000
− TAX2: Additional property tax rate per $10,000
− SUB: Proportion of sublet apartments / rooms
− MEDV: Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000s
Part 2 (Clustering)
In this exercise, you will have to work as a data scientist for a wholesale distributor that works with large
supermarket chains. You obtain a dataset (“wholesale_2023”) containing the annual spending of clients
in different categories of goods. Your task will be to find similar types of clients and group them (via
clustering). Moreover, you should try to understand what defines these different groups / what are their
characteristics.
The variables recorded are:
− Channel: the sales channel used
− Region: the region in that a sale happened
− Fresh: annual spending on fresh products
− Milk: annual spending on milk products
− Grocery: annual spending on grocery products
− Frozen: annual spending on frozen products
− Detergents_Paper: annual spending on detergents and paper products
− Delicassen: annual spending on delicatessen products
